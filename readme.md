# Belle-Idee 
A web app for sharing ideas, inspirations and influences through local and global communities.
We provide an open source repo for anyone to reuse, reference, or create pull requests from.
While the production site runs on a private repo the two are frequently merged.


Idee is a community application and while we run a cloud version for the global community, you are welcome to use it for a local or private community use as well.
With the ease of replication others may create similar or cheaper cloud versions Idee.  
This is a risk we must take for any individual or community to have the ability to create a private instance of Idee.
