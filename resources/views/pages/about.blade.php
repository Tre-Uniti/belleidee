    <h2>About Belle-Idee</h2>
    <h4>Belle-Idee is a platform and community for sharing spiritual ideas, inspirations and experiences.</h4>
    <div id = "centerTextContent">
   As users participate within the community those we are most influential (elevation+extension) will be asked to become moderators.
    After a period of moderation they may be asked to become an Admin.
    <p>There are two types of Admins:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Volunteer: Assist with beacon and sponsor requests as well as adjudication of intolerance. </li>
       <li>Employee: Volunteer duties + job function such as development, support, marketing, or operations.</li>
    </ul>
    Only Admin users are eligible to be elected as a legacy guide for a given belief.
    After serving as an employee Admin those users who continue to be most influential may receive a promotion to Guardian.
    Guardians have the duties of an employee Admin as well as oversight of the community questions, beliefs, and legacy elections.
    <p>In this way the Idee community is guided and administered by users who are influential and experienced.</p>
